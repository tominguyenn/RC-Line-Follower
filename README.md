# Arduino RC Line Follower


- Designed and assembled a remote-controlled car using the Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit V4 and Arduino Uno.
- Programmed motor control via IR remote, enabling directional movement and speed control.
- Integrated ultrasonic and IR sensors to develop an autopilot feature that allows the car to navigate a road playmat autonomously.
- Implemented line-following logic for path tracking.
- Gained experience in embedded systems, sensor interfacing, PWM motor control, and real-time debugging.

## Features
- Line Following: The car autonomously follows a black line on a white background using three infrared (IR) sensors placed in the front.
- Wiggle Search: If the car loses the line, it will wiggle left and right to find the line again.
- Simple Motor Control: The car uses PWM to control its speed and direction.
- Serial Debugging: Provides real-time data on sensor readings for debugging and analysis.
